# Stationary bandits - useful code bits
bits of code for CSH spring school (so far only R)

Raw equinox 2020 dataset available from http://seshatdatabank.info/databrowser/downloads.html is used (named "equinox2020_dataset_seshat.csv" in my folder) is used but is not part of this repository and needs to be downloaded separately

It a good idea to start from the **autoencoders_seshat.Rproj** file - it will open R studio with the equivalent settings as mine 

**01_process_data.R** can help you convert the original raw entries to a wide data format, where each row is one of the seshat places at a single timestep and each column in one of the variables.
